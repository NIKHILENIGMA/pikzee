Once the container is running and all dependencies are installed, you need to set up local environment variables and the database.

## 1. Environment Variables
The Dev Container already provides placeholders for configuration. Copy the example file and fill in your unique values:

```bash

# In the container's terminal:
cp .env.example .env.local

```
You must fill in the following keys in your .env.local file:

| Variable | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLERK_SECRET_KEY | Your personal Clerk dashboard (ask team lead) | Securely authenticate users. |
| DATABASE_URL | See next step (local database) | Connection string for the local PostgreSQL database. |

## 2. Local Database Setup

We use Docker Compose inside the Dev Container to run the PostgreSQL database locally.

### First Run:

Open a second terminal window inside the Dev Container (Terminal -> New Terminal).

Start the database service:
```bash 

docker compose up -d postgres
```

This launches the database on port `5432` and exposes it to the container environment. The DATABASE_URL is typically set automatically in the container to point to the host: postgres://user:password@postgres:5432/pikzeedb.

**Apply Schema Migrations**:
Run the following command to initialize the database schema:

Apply Schema Migrations:
Run the following command to initialize the database schema:

npm run db:migrate

You are now ready to run the application services!
