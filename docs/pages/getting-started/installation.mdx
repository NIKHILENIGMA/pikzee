This project uses a Dev Container to ensure all team members work with an identical and pre-configured environment. This approach simplifies onboarding significantly.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites (For the Container Environment)

To run the Dev Container for Pikzee, you only need three core tools installed on your local machine.

| Tool | Minimum Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Git | Latest Stable | For cloning the repository. |
| Docker | v20.10+ | The engine that runs the containerized environment. |
| VS Code | Latest Stable | The recommended IDE, along with the Dev Containers Extension. |

## Dev Container Setup Steps
Once you have the prerequisites, follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/NIKHILENGIMA/Pikezee-Client.git

# Go inside the project
cd Pikezee-Client

```

### Step 2: Open in VS Code:
```bash
code .
```

### Step 3: Reopen in Container:
VS Code will automatically detect the .devcontainer/devcontainer.json file. A prompt will appear in the bottom-right corner asking, "Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen in Container?"
- Click "Reopen in Container".

The Dev Container build process will now:

- Build the image defined in .devcontainer/Dockerfile.
- Install Node.js dependencies with pnpm (run `pnpm install`).
- Install the VS Code extensions specified for the dev container.
- Configure and start Nginx and Redis services inside the container.
- Configure and start a PostgreSQL service inside the container
- Forward required ports (e.g., 3000 for frontend, 5000 for backend, 5432 for PostgreSQL) via devcontainer.json.
