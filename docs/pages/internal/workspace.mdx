# Workspace Implementation

This document provides an overview of the workspace implementation in the Pikzee backend.

## Architecture

The workspace module is designed to manage user workspaces, including their creation, update, deletion, and retrieval. The core of the architecture revolves around the following components:

- **WorkspaceController:** The Express controller that handles incoming workspace-related requests.
- **WorkspaceService:** The service that contains the core business logic for managing workspaces.
- **WorkspaceRepository:** The repository responsible for all database interactions related to workspaces.

## Flow of a Workspace Operation

1.  A request is sent to a workspace endpoint (e.g., `/workspaces`).
2.  The `WorkspaceController` receives the request.
3.  The controller calls the appropriate `WorkspaceService` method, passing the request details.
4.  The `WorkspaceService` orchestrates the business logic, which may involve interacting with `MemberService` and `UserService`.
5.  The `WorkspaceService` calls the `WorkspaceRepository` to interact with the database.
6.  The `WorkspaceRepository` uses `drizzle-orm` to execute the database query.
7.  The result is returned up the chain to the controller, which sends the response.
