# Member Implementation

This document provides an overview of the member implementation in the Pikzee backend.

## Architecture

The member module is designed to manage members within a workspace, including adding, updating permissions for, and removing members. The core of the architecture revolves around the following components:

- **MemberController:** The Express controller that handles incoming member-related requests.
- **MemberService:** The service that contains the core business logic for managing members.
- **MemberRepository:** The repository responsible for all database interactions related to members.

## Flow of a Member Operation

1.  A request is sent to a member endpoint (e.g., `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/members`).
2.  The `MemberController` receives the request.
3.  The controller calls the appropriate `MemberService` method, passing the request details.
4.  The `MemberService` orchestrates the business logic.
5.  The `MemberService` calls the `MemberRepository` to interact with the database.
6.  The `MemberRepository` uses `drizzle-orm` to execute the database query.
7.  The result is returned up the chain to the controller, which sends the response.
