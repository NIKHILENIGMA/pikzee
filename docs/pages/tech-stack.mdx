## Why These Technologies?

### TypeScript (v5.3)

**Reason:** TypeScript is mandatory for Pikzee to achieve end-to-end type safety, which is critical for a complex, full-stack application.

- Performance & Scalability: It catches errors at compile-time that would otherwise become difficult-to-debug runtime issues in production, especially as the codebase and team size grow. Shared data models (schemas) between the frontend and backend minimize integration bugs, greatly improving developer velocity.

- Community Support: As the standard for modern enterprise JavaScript development, TypeScript enjoys exceptional tooling (IntelliSense, refactoring) and massive community adoption.

<hr />
### Vite

**Reason behind using vite?**: Chosen over alternatives (like Webpack) for its extremely fast startup time and Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

- Enables near-instant feedback during development, boosting productivity and supporting faster iteration cycles for large component trees.
- Excellent and rapidly growing adoption, with robust official plugins for React and TypeScript.

### React (v19.1)

**Reason:** The industry standard for building modular, component-based user interfaces.

- Its component model allows for efficient rendering and reusable UI elements, which is key for a feature-rich application like Pikzee.

- Unmatched ecosystem size, libraries (like Shadcn, Tiptap), and community knowledge base.

### TanStack Query & Table

**Reason:** Decouples data fetching/caching logic from UI components.

- Crucial for performance: Handles server-state synchronization, caching, background data fetching, and intelligent retries, making the app feel fast and responsive without complex manual state management.

- High adoption rate in complex React applications, ensuring reliable and well-tested solutions for data handling.

### Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI

**Reason:** Tailwind provides the utility-first CSS foundation, and Shadcn UI provides pre-built, accessible components styled with Tailwind.

- Shadcn's 'copy-and-paste' approach ensures minimal bundle size, as we only include the component code we use. Tailwind's JIT mode only compiles used styles, ensuring lightning-fast load times.

- The combination is a rising standard for fast, high-quality, and highly customizable design systems.

### Tiptap

**Reason:** Selected specifically to power the Notion-style script editor.

- Provides a "headless" framework built on ProseMirror, giving us low-level control over the editor's DOM structure for deep integration with our data model (and subsequent AI/deployment features) without compromising performance.

- Strong backing from the ProseMirror ecosystem, ensuring long-term maintainability.

<hr />

### Node.js & Express
**Reason:** Provides a lightweight, non-blocking environment ideal for the high I/O operations common in media/file management and API calls.

- Express is a minimal, fast, and unopinionated foundation that keeps overhead low. Node.js's asynchronous nature handles concurrent requests efficiently.

- Huge, mature ecosystem with modules for virtually any integration (AWS, Google, etc.).

### Zod (v4.0.5)
**Reason:** The core of our API contract. Used to define all input/output schemas, from API requests to Drizzle ORM model definitions.

- Eliminates manual validation code, providing high confidence that data adheres to expected structures, thus reducing runtime bugs and security vulnerabilities.

- Excellent integration with TypeScript and tools like drizzle-zod (for shared schemas), making it a gold standard for type-safe validation.

### BullMQ (Queue & Worker) & Redis

**Reason:** Essential for handling non-immediate, long-running tasks like AI Media Transformation and One-Click Deployments.

- Critical for Scalability: This architecture decouples the main web server (Express) from CPU-intensive work. The main server responds instantly, and heavy tasks are offloaded to dedicated workers, preventing API timeouts and service bottlenecks. 
- Redis provides the fast, persistent backbone for the job queue.

- BullMQ is a modern, TypeScript-first, and feature-rich library built on the robust foundation of Redis.

### AWS SDK & Imagekit

**Reason:** Media Handling Strategy: AWS S3 serves as the reliable, massive storage layer for all raw and processed media files, while Imagekit acts as the specialized transformation engine.

- Imagekit provides real-time image optimization, resizing, and AI transformations via a simple URL API. This offloads resource-heavy media processing from our own backend servers, ensuring high performance and low latency delivery globally via its CDN.

- AWS S3 is the industry standard for object storage. Imagekit is a specialized, well-regarded service in the media management space.

### Clerk Express
**Reason:** Provides comprehensive, secure authentication and user management out-of-the-box.

- Offloading authentication/authorization logic to a dedicated service frees up backend development cycles and ensures enterprise-grade security standards are met without significant internal effort.

- Webhooks for user events: Configure Clerk to emit user lifecycle events (create, update, delete, session changes) to a backend webhook endpoint. This allows the backend to react (provision profiles, sync metadata, revoke access, etc.) without handling authentication flows directly, decoupling auth from application business logic.

- Excellent documentation and strong community focus on developer experience.

<hr />
### PostgreSQL (v15.3)
**Reason:** A powerful, reliable, and feature-rich relational database known for its transactional integrity and advanced indexing capabilities.

- Highly scalable, particularly for complex queries needed for efficient file/script searching and relational data integrity across workspaces.

- Mature, robust, and industry-proven, ensuring long-term reliability.

### Drizzle ORM (v0.44.5)
**Reason:** A modern, headless, and non-intrusive ORM.

- Performance Focus: Drizzle is designed to be highly performant and close to raw SQL, avoiding unnecessary abstraction layers common in older ORMs. Its compile-time type safety ensures query correctness before runtime.

- Excellent drizzle-zod integration allows us to derive ORM types from our central Zod schemas, maintaining consistency across the entire stack (Database -> Backend -> Frontend).
